# λε-net
## A in-progress repo focusing on easy-to-use, portable, image classification/generation PyTorch models.
**This repository is still currently being built!** Nonetheless, if you would like to navigate the cut-and-pasted-and-it's-so-ugly-it's-sinful codebase, go right ahead. 
In each folder there:
- is a .py file (for training it yourself, editing parameters and such)
- might be a .pth file (for loading a pre-trained model)
- might be a README.md file (for help with operation)

## Dependcies
- *torchvision[^1]* 0.15.2
- *torch[^1]* 2.0.1
- matplotlib 3.7.2
- numpy 1.25.1
- python >= 3.0 (of course)
  
Install all of these with:
`pip3 install matplotlib numpy`

[^1]: torch comes in different varities that you can install, find the right one at [the PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org). This auto-generated command also installs torchvision and torchaudio alongside torch itself.


## System Requirments
If your computer *can* run Linux, it ***probably*** *can* run this.
No joke, I compiled most of the scripts on a laptop from 2008.

## Disclaimer
I am an absolute idiot. Almost all these scripts are 90% cut-and-paste from PyTorch tutorials. 
This will change as I gain more knowledge, as I hope to really bring these scripts to fruition and stability. It's a **long** way until there though.
